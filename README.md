## What is M*?

**M\*** (pronounced *"M-star"*) is a serving system for the new generation of **composite multimodal models** — models built from structurally distinct components (vision encoders, transformer backbones, diffusion and flow heads, audio codecs, action generators, world-model predictors) whose execution path changes with the input and the task.

LLM serving stacks assume inference is a single autoregressive loop. Composite models broke that assumption. M\*'s core idea is the **Walk Graph**: a model is a dataflow graph of its components, and every request is a *Walk* over that graph. A single runtime serves unified multimodal models, omni models, speech LMs, vision-language-action policies, and world models — at or above the performance of engines specialized for each.

**Fast** — per-component fast paths, matched to each component's bottleneck:
- Paged attention (FlashInfer) and continuous batching for autoregressive backbones
- CUDA-graph capture for encoders and decode
- Classifier-free-guidance parallelism for diffusion / flow
- Sliding-window chunk streaming for audio codecs
- Component-level disaggregation with pluggable tensor transport (shared memory, TCP, RDMA)

**Flexible** — the abstraction mirrors the model:
- One small Python file per model declares its component graph and its Walks
- A YAML file maps components to GPUs at per-component, per-walk granularity — arbitrary disaggregation, no code changes
- Text, image, audio, video, and robot actions, in and out
- A **Python SDK**, an **OpenAI-compatible API**, and a native streaming endpoint

> **Roadmap.** M\* is evolving toward *many-model, agentic* multimodal serving — routing requests across many models and tools within one graph-scheduled runtime.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -e .            # install M*
mminf serve bagel          # one command — launch a server (default: http://localhost:8000)
```

Other models: `mminf serve qwen3_omni` · `mminf serve orpheus` · `mminf serve pi05` · `mminf serve vjepa2`

**Python SDK** — works for every model (text, image, audio, video):

```python
from mminf import MMInfClient
client = MMInfClient("http://localhost:8000")

client.chat("What is the capital of France?").text          # text
client.generate_image("a cat in a hat")                     # → PNG bytes   (BAGEL)
client.tts("Hello there", voice="tara").to_wav("out.wav")   # → speech      (Orpheus)

for event in client.chat("Tell me a story", stream=True):   # streaming
    print(getattr(event, "text", ""), end="", flush=True)
```

**OpenAI-compatible API** — drop-in for `bagel`, `qwen3_omni`, and `orpheus`:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="none")

client.chat.completions.create(model="bagel", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}])
client.audio.speech.create(model="orpheus", input="hi", voice="tara")   # text-to-speech
client.images.generate(model="bagel", prompt="a cat")                   # image generation
```

Runnable scripts and `curl` examples live in [`examples/`](examples/). Power users can launch any
deployment with an explicit config: `mminf-serve --config configs/<model>.yaml`.

## Supported models

| Model | Family | Input → Output | Endpoints |
|-------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| [BAGEL](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance-Seed/BAGEL-7B-MoT) | Unified multimodal | text, image → text, image | `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/images/generations` |
| [Qwen3-Omni](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct) | Omni | text, image, audio, video → text, speech | `/v1/chat/completions` |
| [Orpheus](https://huggingface.co/canopylabs/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft) | Speech LM | text → speech | `/v1/audio/speech` |
| [Pi0.5](https://huggingface.co/lerobot/pi05_base) | Vision-language-action | text, image, state → robot actions | `/generate` |
| [V-JEPA 2 / 2-AC](https://huggingface.co/facebook/vjepa2-vitl-fpc64-256) | World model | video (+ actions) → latents, rollouts | `/generate` |

Every model is reachable through the SDK and the native `/generate` endpoint; the OpenAI-compatible
routes cover the chat, speech, and image models.

## How it works

```
HTTP / SDK  →  API Server  →  Conductor  →  Workers (one per GPU)  →  streaming results
                                  │              │
                          walks the graph,   own subgraphs; route tensors
                          schedules walks    directly to one another
```

A model declares a **computation graph** of components and a set of named **Walks** (e.g.
`prefill`, `decode`, `image_gen`). The **Conductor** turns each request into a walk over that graph
and schedules it; **Workers** each own a subgraph on their GPU and stream tensors directly to one
another. Logical graph structure is decoupled from physical placement, so the same model runs
single-GPU or fully disaggregated by changing only the YAML `node_groups`. Four composable
primitives — `Sequential`, `Parallel`, `Loop`, and a cross-partition
`StreamingGraphEdge` — express every model family above. See the [paper](#citation) for the full design.

## Performance

- **~30% lower** end-to-end latency than vLLM-Omni on BAGEL text-to-image (**~50% lower** on image editing, with CFG parallelism).
- **Lower real-time factor and up to ~15% higher throughput** than vLLM-Omni on Qwen3-Omni text-to-speech at larger batch sizes.
- **On par with VoxServe**, a speech-specialized engine, on Orpheus TTS.
- **Up to 12.5×** faster than the V-JEPA 2-AC rollout baseline for robotic planning.

Full methodology and numbers are in the [paper](#citation).
