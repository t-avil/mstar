Installation
============

Requirements
------------

- **Python 3.12+**.
- **Linux with an NVIDIA GPU** and a recent **CUDA** toolkit for the GPU model
  families. A CPU-only machine can exercise the graph/worker plumbing in *dummy mode*
  (submodules return ``None``) for development and the modular tests, but not real model
  inference.
- Enough GPU memory for the model you intend to serve — several families (e.g.
  BAGEL-7B, Qwen3-Omni-30B) are multi-GPU-class models.

Install from source
-------------------

``mminf`` is installed from source in editable mode. We recommend `uv
<https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ to create the Python 3.12 environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/merceod/multimodal_inference.git
   cd multimodal_inference

   # Create and activate a Python 3.12 virtualenv (--seed adds pip to it)
   uv venv --python 3.12 --seed
   source .venv/bin/activate

   uv pip install --torch-backend=auto -e .

This pulls in the core runtime (PyTorch, FastAPI/Uvicorn, ZMQ, …) and installs the two
console scripts, ``mminf`` and ``mminf-serve``.

.. important::

   **Always pass** ``--torch-backend=auto``. ``mminf`` pins **PyTorch 2.9**
   (``torch==2.9.1`` / ``torchvision==0.24.1`` / ``torchaudio==2.9.1``); ``sgl-kernel``
   (Qwen3-Omni) is built against torch 2.9, so newer torch won't work. The flag tells
   ``uv`` to detect your driver's CUDA version and fetch the **matching** torch build —
   cu128 on a CUDA 12.x box, cu130 on a CUDA 13.x box. This matters because the
   source-compiled extensions (``flash-attn``, ``sgl-kernel``) build against your *system*
   CUDA toolkit, whose major version must match torch's. Without the flag ``uv`` installs
   PyPI's default (cu128) build, which then fails to compile ``flash-attn`` on a CUDA 13
   machine with a *"detected CUDA version mismatches … PyTorch"* error. You can set it once
   with ``export UV_TORCH_BACKEND=auto`` instead of repeating the flag. See `Matching your
   CUDA toolkit`_ for details and the manual fallback.

Optional dependencies
---------------------

Model families and some output formats need extra packages, exposed as pip *extras*:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 78

   * - Extra
     - Installs / use for
   * - ``.[bagel]``
     - BAGEL runtime: ``transformers``, ``flashinfer-python``, ``safetensors``,
       ``einops``, ``Pillow``, ``torchvision`` / ``torchaudio`` / ``torchcodec``,
       ``huggingface-hub``, ``regex``, and ``mooncake-transfer-engine`` (RDMA transport).
   * - ``.[qwen3_omni]``
     - Qwen3-Omni runtime: the BAGEL set plus ``qwen-omni-utils``, ``sgl-kernel``, and
       ``datasets``. **Also needs** ``flash-attn``, which is installed separately —
       see `flash-attn (Qwen3-Omni)`_.
   * - ``.[orpheus]``
     - Orpheus TTS runtime: ``transformers``, ``flashinfer-python``, ``safetensors``,
       ``einops``, ``huggingface-hub``, ``mooncake-transfer-engine``.
   * - ``.[pi05]``
     - Pi0.5 runtime: ``transformers``, ``flashinfer-python``, ``safetensors``,
       ``triton``, ``huggingface-hub``, ``mooncake-transfer-engine``.
   * - ``.[vjepa2]`` / ``.[vjepa2_ac]``
     - V-JEPA 2 runtime: ``safetensors``, ``torchcodec``, ``huggingface-hub``,
       ``mooncake-transfer-engine`` (``vjepa2_ac`` also adds ``flashinfer-python``).
   * - ``.[audio]``
     - ``soundfile`` — only needed to return **non-WAV** audio containers (mp3/flac/…)
       from the OpenAI/SDK audio surfaces. WAV/PCM output works without it.
   * - ``.[dev]``
     - ``ruff`` + ``pytest`` for linting and the test suite.
   * - ``.[all]``
     - The union of every model extra above — installs the full runtime for all model
       families in one shot. Convenient for a machine that serves multiple models; heavier
       and slower to install than a single family's extra. (Still excludes ``flash-attn`` —
       see `flash-attn (Qwen3-Omni)`_.)

Combine extras as needed (keep ``--torch-backend=auto`` on every install):

.. code-block:: bash

   uv pip install --torch-backend=auto -e ".[bagel,audio,dev]"

.. tip::

   If you're just getting started or have the disk/time to spare, ``.[all]`` is the
   recommended install — it pulls every model family's runtime so any model works out of
   the box, with no need to track which extra goes with which model:

   .. code-block:: bash

      uv pip install --torch-backend=auto -e ".[all,dev]"

.. note::

   ``torch``, ``torchvision``, and ``torchaudio`` are already in the base install; each
   model extra adds that family's remaining runtime — FlashInfer for the autoregressive
   backbones, Transformers, safetensors, any codec/media libraries, and the Mooncake RDMA
   transport for disaggregated deployments.

GPU libraries
-------------

The GPU model families depend on:

- **FlashInfer** (``flashinfer-python``) — paged attention and continuous batching for the
  autoregressive backbones (every model with a ``KV_CACHE`` node runs attention through it).
- **flash-attn** — used by Qwen3-Omni. **Not installed by any extra**; install it separately
  (see `flash-attn (Qwen3-Omni)`_).
- **mooncake-transfer-engine** — RDMA tensor transport for multi-GPU, disaggregated
  deployments. Single-node deployments can use shared-memory (``SHM``) or ``TCP`` transport
  instead (see :doc:`serving`).

Apart from ``flash-attn``, these are installed by the extras above. Your installed ``torch``
must match your system CUDA toolkit — ``--torch-backend=auto`` handles that for you (next
section).

flash-attn (Qwen3-Omni)
-----------------------

``flash-attn`` is only needed for **Qwen3-Omni**, and it is **not** pulled in by
``.[qwen3_omni]`` or ``.[all]`` — you install it as a separate step. The reason: flash-attn
publishes no wheels on PyPI, so ``pip``/``uv`` fall back to compiling it from source, which is
slow and **fails outright on CUDA 13** (its bundled CUTLASS predates CUDA 13's vector-type
ABI change). Skip the build by installing the prebuilt wheel that matches your stack.

The wheels live on flash-attn's `GitHub releases
<https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases>`_, named by CUDA major, torch
version, Python tag, and C++ ABI. With the pinned **torch 2.9** and **Python 3.12** you want a
``torch2.9 / cp312 / cxx11abiTRUE`` wheel — the only choice left is the CUDA major, which must
match **your installed torch's** CUDA, not your system toolkit. Check it first:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -c "import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)"   # 12.8 -> cu12,  13.0 -> cu13

Then install the matching wheel by **direct URL** (don't use ``--find-links`` — uv sorts the
``+cu13…`` local version above ``+cu12…`` and will grab cu13 even on a CUDA 12 box):

.. code-block:: bash

   # torch built for CUDA 12.x (cu12 — the default / most common)
   uv pip install \
     "https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.8.3/flash_attn-2.8.3+cu12torch2.9cxx11abiTRUE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl"

   # torch built for CUDA 13.x (cu13)
   uv pip install \
     "https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.8.3/flash_attn-2.8.3+cu13torch2.9cxx11abiTRUE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl"

Because it's a binary wheel nothing compiles, so your *system* CUDA version is irrelevant —
only the torch build matters. Verify with:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -c "import flash_attn; print(flash_attn.__version__)"

(An ``undefined symbol`` error on import means the wheel's ``cu1x`` / ``torch2.9`` tag doesn't
match your installed torch — recheck ``python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__,
torch.version.cuda)"`` and pick the matching wheel.)

Matching your CUDA toolkit
--------------------------

PyPI's default ``torch`` wheel targets one specific CUDA release (cu128), which may not match
your machine. ``flash-attn`` and ``sgl-kernel`` compile from source against your *system*
CUDA, so a mismatch with torch's CUDA breaks the build. The simplest fix is to let ``uv``
choose the right build automatically:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv pip install --torch-backend=auto -e ".[all]"

``--torch-backend=auto`` detects your driver (via ``nvidia-smi``) and selects the matching
PyTorch index — cu128 on CUDA 12.x, cu130 on CUDA 13.x — for the runtime *and* for the
isolated environments that build ``flash-attn`` / ``sgl-kernel``. The same command therefore
works unchanged across machines. (Needs a recent ``uv`` — run ``uv pip install --help`` and
look for ``--torch-backend`` if unsure; ``export UV_TORCH_BACKEND=auto`` is equivalent.)

**Manual fallback.** If you can't use the flag, install the pinned torch trio from the
matching CUDA index **first**, then install ``mminf`` (the resolver then treats the
requirement as already satisfied):

.. code-block:: bash

   # pick the index for your CUDA toolkit: cu128 (CUDA 12.8), cu130 (CUDA 13.x), …
   uv pip install torch==2.9.1 torchvision==0.24.1 torchaudio==2.9.1 \
       --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
   uv pip install -e ".[all]"

Check your driver's CUDA version with ``nvidia-smi`` and pick the closest build at
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/. Keep all three packages on the same ``2.9`` /
``0.24`` line — ``torchvision`` and ``torchaudio`` are versioned in lockstep with ``torch``.

Verify the install
------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   python -c "import mminf; print('mminf import OK')"
   mminf --help
   mminf-serve --help
