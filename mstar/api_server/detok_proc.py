"""MSTAR_DETOK_PROC (#13) — off-process token->text detokenization.

vLLM keeps its API/serve process free of the per-token detokenize + postprocess
cost by running detok in a separate OS process (EngineCore vs. API proc). Ours
does not: the ``PreprocessWorkerThread`` runs ``model.postprocess`` — the
tokenizer decode — inline on the uvicorn/serve process, and a py-spy profile put
``_postprocess_batch`` at 23% of that process's CPU floor, contending for the one
GIL the HTTP serving loop also needs.

This module moves that work to a dedicated child process. The serve-side data
worker keeps ALL request-context state and ALL emit ordering (MSTAR_ORDERED_EMIT
/ MSTAR_EMIT_SEQNUMS reorder buffers, per-rid cleanup, the tensor-read
accounting) exactly where it was; only the leaf ``model.postprocess`` call for
TEXT chunks crosses the process boundary. Because the reorder machinery already
operates on opaque ``ResultChunk`` objects, deferring a chunk's ``data`` changes
nothing it does — the chunk is reordered as before and its bytes are filled in
later, off-process.

Design (see docs / the emit_sidecar.py prior art in mstar/worker):

- ONE detok child process per serve process (like vLLM's single detok proc, and
  like the emit sidecar). A single process consuming its input FIFO and emitting
  its output FIFO preserves per-rid order for free: the data worker submits a
  rid's chunks in the already-reordered order, so FIFO-in == FIFO-out == correct
  delivery order. We do not fan out across cores — the goal is to get the decode
  OFF the serve GIL, not to parallelize decode.

- Only ``modality == "text"`` is offloaded. Audio/image ``postprocess`` is cheap
  (a ``.numpy().tobytes()``), is not the GIL hog, and would mean shipping large
  tensors across the boundary — those stay inline.

- Byte-identity: the child loads the SAME lightweight tokenizer-only model the
  serve process builds (same ``get_model_class(model_name)(...)`` construction,
  same model_kwargs) and calls the SAME ``model.postprocess`` on a tensor
  reconstructed from the shipped ints/dtype/dims. No incremental/prefix detok
  state is introduced (the model's text postprocess is a stateless per-chunk
  ``tokenizer.decode``); introducing prefix state would change bytes, so we keep
  it per-chunk. Per-rid registration/drop records are still exchanged so the
  child can free any per-rid structure on completion/abort (and as the hook a
  future stateful detok would need).

- Boot-time only: process topology cannot follow ``MSTAR_DYNFLAGS`` (a child is
  spawned at init, exactly as the emit sidecar documents). ``MSTAR_DETOK_PROC``
  is read ONCE when the ``PreprocessWorker`` is constructed; A/B is via two
  server boots, not a runtime flip.

- Failure semantics: the child dying (or its input queue saturating) is a
  PERMANENT fall back to the inline path, never a hang and never a dropped
  request. Any chunk already handed to the child but not yet returned is
  re-postprocessed inline, in submit order, before the flag flips — so per-rid
  order is preserved and every request still completes with correct bytes. New
  chunks then postprocess inline in the serve process, as with the flag off.
