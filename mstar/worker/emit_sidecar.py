"""MSTAR_EMIT_SIDECAR.

One pure-CPU sidecar PROCESS per worker owns the client-bound emit path for
"sidecar-scoped" requests: emit message construction (full/slim items and the
slim-template protocol state ``_slim_emit_sent`` / ``_slim_emit_loop_layout``),
the api_server transport, the three WGD-feeding accumulators
(``pending_new_tokens`` / ``current_output_chunks`` / ``output_loop_indices``),
and WORKER_GRAPHS_DONE assembly + conductor transport. The worker main thread
feeds it one compact ``StepRecord`` per step: tuples of ints and interned
indices; a GraphEdge rides a record only at boundary rate (first inline
template per (rid, name), or a non-inline edge whose fresh tensor_info the
consumer must fetch via SHM).

Ownership contract (all-or-nothing per structure):

- The worker NEVER writes the three accumulators for a scoped rid — every
  write becomes a record field, on the steady, boundary, and non-inline
  paths alike (see ``Worker._send_outputs_sidecar``). WGD is thus assembled
  by a single owner.
- Scoping is decided ONCE per rid at admission, from the full
  ``worker_graph_to_workers`` map (which covers every partition), so a later
  partition's add can never flip a rid between owners mid-flight — the
  split-brain trap this avoids.
- Tensor lifecycle (register_for_send / SHM-skip / producer-ref release) and
  route/store/check_stop stay on the worker; each record item's inline flag
  is derived from the worker's SHM-skip decision.

One-way data flow: the sidecar produces nothing the worker, scheduler, or
tensor_manager ever reads — this is the central safety invariant. Transport:
a single ZMQ PUSH/PULL pair per worker — FIFO gives template-before-slim and
token order per rid for free. Never add a second worker→sidecar socket.

Ordering audit: besides WORKER_GRAPHS_DONE, the worker sends the conductor
only SETUP_DONE (startup, before any request exists) and — on sidecar
failure — ABORT_REQUEST for stranded rids. Nothing else implies partition
completion, so moving WGD into the sidecar cannot reorder it against other
completion-implying worker→conductor traffic.

Flags: MSTAR_EMIT_SIDECAR (default "0") is read ONCE at worker init. The
sidecar is a spawned process, so this flag cannot follow MSTAR_DYNFLAGS flips
(process spawn requires a static flag; A/B via two-server alternation, not
dyn_ab). Scoped-rid construction is pinned to the winning emit stack
(MSTAR_BATCH_EMIT + MSTAR_SLIM_EMIT + MSTAR_SLIM_EMIT2 semantics); the worker
refuses to enable the sidecar unless those flags are on, so the flag-on
stream is byte-identical to the legacy stack's and the flag-off code paths
stay untouched. Because the scoped construction is static, a "a flip forces
full-template re-emission" rule has no trigger here: neither
MSTAR_EMIT_SIDECAR nor the scoped slim semantics can flip at runtime.

Failure policy — a dead sidecar fails fast, it never hangs the client: the
worker never blocks on the sidecar. The PUSH socket has a bounded SNDHWM and
sends NOBLOCK; an HWM trip or a dead process is a permanent drain-and-disable
— legacy path for new work, ABORT_REQUEST for rids whose emit/WGD state is
stranded in the sidecar. Per-step fallback is forbidden: interleaving two
producers would break the per-(rid, name) FIFO the slim-template protocol
needs.

# MSTAR_MERGED_PREFILL, the merged prefill_multimodal walk). Stage 1 excluded
# these not because of any structural incompatibility — the E4b lesson was
# about Talker/Code2Wav's STREAMING audio-output edges, and prefill_vision
# carries none: its Thinker node emits exactly the same shape prefill_text's
# does (one EMIT_TO_CLIENT "new_token" text edge, output_modality="text",
# plus the thinker_states/thinker_mask StreamingGraphEdges to Talker — see
# qwen3_omni_model.py's prefill_vision/prefill_multimodal Sequentials). It was
# simply never in Stage 1's validated coverage (LEARNINGS_TTFT.md #12) and
# was left conservatively flat pending its own walk-gating coverage guard,
# the same way s2t/i2s were guarded for Stage 1. The item-processing code
# path itself is already exercised for a
# prefill-shaped row (non-inline, D2H-fallback new_token — see
# test_mixed_walk_rows_byte_identical's prem-less chunk row, which has the
# identical shape to a prefill_vision Thinker emit): only the admission gate
# needs widening, no new item-processing branch.
#
# "encode_vision" (the standalone vision-encoder walk registered only under
# MSTAR_CHUNKED_PREFILL_V2_VISION) has NO EMIT_TO_CLIENT edges at all — its
# outputs are persist-only, routed to EMPTY_DESTINATION — so it can never
# produce a sidecar item. It still must be listed here: the admission check
# is whole-rid (every walk the rid's worker graphs *could* run on this
# worker, not just the walk of the step at hand — see worker.py
# ``_add_new_request``), so a chunked-vision i2t rid's my_walks includes
# "encode_vision" alongside "prefill_vision" and must clear the same subset
# test. Kept as a SEPARATE set (not folded into SIDECAR_WALKS) so
# MSTAR_SIDECAR_I2T=0 leaves SIDECAR_WALKS, and therefore every rid's
# admission decision, byte-identical to before this flag existed.
#
# NOTE (topology caveat, see fix20/ideas/s2-sidecar-i2t.md "risks"): the
# admission subset check is per WORKER, using the full set of walks that
# could ever land there (all_worker_graph_ids_to_graph_walks), not the
# walks this particular request actually uses. On the shipped PD-disagg
# configs (qwen3omni_2gpu_pd.yaml, qwen3omni_pd_disaggregated.yaml) the
# prefill-Thinker node_group's ``graph_walks:`` bundles prefill_text,
# prefill_audio AND prefill_vision together on one rank, so widening this
# set with vision walks alone does not by itself unblock that rank's
# admission check (prefill_audio remains outside the allowed set) — it
# takes effect on the DECODE rank (my_walks == {thinker_decode} there,
# already a clean subset) and on any topology where prefill_vision is
# isolated on its own node_group.
