"""Ulysses sequence parallelism — model-agnostic primitives.

Sequence parallelism (SP) shards the token sequence across an ``sp_group`` and
replicates the weights, the mirror image of tensor parallelism (which shards the
weights and replicates the sequence). Attention is the only operator that needs
the whole sequence, so Ulysses brackets it with two all-to-alls: the first turns
a sequence-sharded ``[seq/P, heads, dim]`` tensor into a head-sharded
``[seq, heads/P, dim]`` one (full sequence, this rank's slice of heads), the
attention runs locally, and the second converts back. Net effect: attention runs
exactly as if at tensor-parallel degree ``tp*sp`` — the kernel (``run_attention``)
is unchanged — while every pointwise op (norms, MLP, residuals) runs on the
``seq/P`` shard for free.

These helpers take an ``sp_group`` (a :class:`CommGroup` over the SP axis of the
mesh; trivial when ``sp_size == 1``) and are model-independent: any attention that
projects to ``[tokens, heads, head_dim]`` and calls a ``run_attention(q, k, v)``
can use :func:`ulysses_attention`. ``seq_sizes`` is the per-rank token count along
the sequence (need not be equal — sequences indivisible by ``sp`` are handled
without padding); the scatter/gather of the residual stream at the model boundary
uses the same split.
