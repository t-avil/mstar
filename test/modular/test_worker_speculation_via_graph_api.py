"""Pin down the graph-layer surface that the worker's speculation path uses.

These tests do not spin up a worker — instead they exercise the
``ingest_for_speculation`` / ``ready_for_speculation`` API in the exact shape
that ``Worker._try_speculate_next`` relies on after Phase G.1:

  - Per-rid wgios (deep-copied from the same graph) maintain independent
    ``speculative_signals`` state, so ingesting on one rid does not leak into
    another.
  - Ingesting every loop-back output of a node populates the strict gate to
    fire with ``is_new_loop_iter=True``, which is what the worker checks.
  - ``clear_speculative_inputs`` resets the slot so the next outer iter's
    ingestion isn't a no-op (the ``edge.name in node.speculative_signals
    .ready_names`` short-circuit in ``WorkerGraphIO.ingest_for_speculation``).
  - On the gate-failure rollback path: partial ingestion does NOT advance the
    strict gate even when ``ready_signals`` happens to be full from the
    in-flight iter (the canonical Phase A-fix invariant, re-validated for the
    worker's call pattern).
