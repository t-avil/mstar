"""Unit tests for ``WorkerGraphQueues.stop_loops`` per-loop loop-back attribution.

Issue #3 from PR #78: the previous implementation collected every self-loop
edge on the running node, regardless of which loop was being stopped. A node
that participates in two distinct dynamic loops with disjoint loop-back edges
would lose the surviving loop's loop-back tensor when the other loop stopped.

The fix: ``stop_loops`` now returns the ``(edge.name, edge.next_node)`` pairs
of the loop-back signals belonging to the loops that actually matched the
``loop_names`` filter, so the caller can scope the routing-drop to those
edges only.

These tests don't touch the worker — they drive ``WorkerGraphQueues.stop_loops``
directly with a hand-built section to exercise the walker logic in isolation.
