"""Tests for the fix that clears ``_curr_iter_section`` when stops are
applied without speculation.

Background
----------
``_fast_postprocess`` calls ``apply_spec_consumption`` to clear the Loop's
``_curr_iter_section`` so the next ``complete_loops`` can finalize the
loop. That call only fires when ``spec_node_name is not None`` — i.e. when
this iter speculated a successor.

When a stop arrives on an iter that did NOT speculate, the prior iter's
``process_node_outputs`` had already advanced the Loop and queued the
next-iter body. ``register_finished`` sets ``_finished=True``, but
``_curr_iter_section`` still points at that next-iter ``GraphNode``.
``GraphNode.complete_loops`` returns ``LoopCompletionOutput(self)``, so
the Loop's recursion sets ``_curr_iter_section`` back to the GraphNode.
``_iter_done()`` returns False (curr_iter_section is non-None even though
``_finished=True`` and ``_waiting_for_execution`` is empty), the Loop
never reports done, the worker graph never emits WORKER_GRAPHS_DONE, and
the request hangs forever.

Repro: Q3-Omni Thinker hits ``<|im_end|>`` on an iter where the spec
chain happens not to fire (no spec built that iter, or alloc cap reached
under load). Both single and concurrent traffic hung indefinitely.

Fix: in ``_fast_postprocess``, if any rid in ``stopped_loop_backs`` is in
the batch, also call ``apply_spec_consumption(rid, batch.node_name)`` —
the same operation spec uses to mark the just-queued next-iter body as
consumed. This sets ``_curr_iter_section=None``; the subsequent
``complete_loops`` then sees ``_iter_done()=True`` AND ``_finished=True``,
returns ``new_waiting=None``, and the worker graph completes.

These tests drive the relevant graph primitives directly.
