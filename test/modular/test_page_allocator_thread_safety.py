"""Thread-safety tests for ``PageAllocator`` and ``PagedAllocationManager``.

PR #78 issue #4: under speculative scheduling, the plan thread runs ``alloc`` while
the GPU thread runs ``reset_label``. The previous implementation had two
unprotected races:

1. ``PageAllocator.try_allocate`` was ``qsize() < n`` followed by ``n``
   ``get()`` calls — non-atomic. A concurrent ``free`` could land between
   the qsize check and the get loop, false-negating ``try_allocate`` (it
   returns ``None`` even though pages are now available).

2. ``PagedAllocationManager.alloc`` and ``reset_label`` both touch
   ``request_states[rid][label]``. If they interleaved, a freshly allocated
   page list could be freed by a concurrent ``reset_label``, or a page
   list freed by ``reset_label`` could be re-extended by a still-running
   ``alloc`` on the now-stale state object.

The fix added per-allocator + per-manager locks. These tests exercise the
race shapes directly with a thread pool and verify page conservation
across stress runs.
